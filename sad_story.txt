Best Friends are the ones who make our life full of happiness, 
make us smile and bring best out of us but sometimes we get sad because of the best friends.
Here I have collected a few sad stories that will make you cry about best friends. Being Sad is just OKay,
but staying the same is not OKay. NO one in this world is permanent, everyone has a role to play in your life and once it has been done,
they have to leave. Just keep meeting new people and keep learning.
